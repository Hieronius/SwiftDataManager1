Now i have Menu and two different screens with two different states.
You can transition between them without any problems.
All states value updates automatically and also automatically save
You need only to save Initial State when you first run the app

1. Implement a single State for all game to avoid complications with different states. Just make all states in a single file and put references to RootGameState. All properties can be binded via:

	GameState.roomState.enemyHP -= 2

@Model
final class GameState {
	var roomState: RoomState
	var dungeonState: DungeonState
	var townState: TownState
}

2. Feels like i don't need extra references to SwiftDataManager in my locations because it's being tracked automatically. Just load it initially from the memory or create a save default one in CompositionRoot init()

3. Remove "back button from location screens to avoid multiplying states"

4. Implement Pause/Settings/Exit/NewGame/so on buttons in Menu
